        <h1>Topic2</h1>
        <p>The following proxy allows you to generate a small table of contents (TOC). For example, let's say you want the first page of each chapter in a PDF manual to start out with a small TOC, showing the page numbers where subheadings occur within that chapter. In that case, you can insert a mini-TOC proxy into each topic that you plan to use as the beginning of each chapter. Optional Tasks: You can select the depth of the subheadings to be included in the mini-TOC (e.g., up to second- or third-level subheadings). You can also select a style to affect the look of the entire mini-TOC. To do either of these, right-click on the proxy below and select <b>Edit Mini-TOC Proxy</b>. Then choose the appropriate option and/or style. If you need help, press <b>F1</b> when the dialog is open. When you are ready, you can delete this paragraph or replace it with your own text (e.g., "This chapter/section contains the following"). <b>Note:</b> If you cannot see the proxy below, make sure your markers are turned on. To do this, in the local toolbar click the down arrow next to the <b>Show Tags</b> button and select <b>Show Markers</b>.</p>
